Troubleshooting
Q: Game covers not showing or showing placeholder images?

A: Images are downloaded from the internet on first access. Check your network and be patient. If repeated failures occur, refresh the page (Ctrl+F5). Some games may lack cover images, so the platform‑specific placeholder will appear.
Q: Steam Family sync fails?

A: Ensure the userscript is installed and you are logged into the Steam Store. Click the sync button on the Store page. If still failing, reinstall the script or restart your browser.
Q: Epic auth code expired?

A: Auth codes are short‑lived (usually a few minutes). Submit quickly. If expired, just obtain a new one.
Q: After GOG or Cubejoy sync, no games appear?

A: Refresh the Gamepedia page (F5) after successful sync; the platform tab will appear. If still missing, check the corresponding database file (gog_games.db / cubejoy_games.db) for data.
Q: How to change language?

A: Language is auto‑detected from browser settings (Chinese/English). To force a specific language, modify the userLang variable in static/script.js or change your browser’s language preference.
Q: Cached images are corrupted?

A: The program includes automatic corruption detection and repair. When accessing the list, corrupted images will be re‑downloaded. You can also manually delete the platform sub‑folders under cache/ and restart the app.
